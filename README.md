# YelpCamp

A Heroku-hosted application built on Node.js backbone using Express.js and MongoDB that hosts listings of CampSites.

I worked on this project while doing The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele. 
My plan for this project is to improve the UI and turn it into a listing for stray dogs in Dhaka, Bangladesh as opposed to having campsites. This is inspired by an increased drive by the Dhaka City Corporation to relocate dogs, often involving painful methods: https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/dhaka/2020/09/01/dscc-starts-relocating-stray-dogs
I believe this could be a platform for people to spot stray dogs and encourage adoption!
